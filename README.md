Project Description: Average Calculator Microservice
My name is Charishma VU21CSEN0101514, and I developed a project called Average Calculator Microservice using React. This project involves making API calls to fetch numbers and then calculating their average. The entire process is handled within a React component that maintains a dynamic state to reflect previous and current sets of numbers.

Steps I Followed:
Setting Up the Project:

I started by setting up a new React project using create-react-app. This provided a solid foundation for developing the application with React's powerful component-based architecture.
Creating the Core Component:

I created a React component called NumberFetcher to manage all the logic and UI for the project.
In this component, I used the useState hook to create state variables like numbers, windowPrevState, windowCurrState, and average.
I also used the useEffect hook to fetch data as soon as the component was mounted, ensuring that the UI was updated with the latest numbers.
Implementing API Calls:

To fetch numbers from the server, I integrated Axios for making HTTP requests.
I managed secure API access by including an authorization token in the request headers. This token was obtained from the server and was crucial for authenticating the API calls.
The fetched data was then processed and stored in the componentâ€™s state, allowing the UI to display the results dynamically.
Updating the User Interface:

The fetched numbers were displayed in a structured format, showing both the previous and current sets of numbers.
I also included buttons that allowed the user to fetch different types of numbers (like primes, Fibonacci numbers, even numbers, and random numbers) with a simple click.
Basic CSS was applied to ensure the UI was both functional and visually appealing.
Pushing the Code to GitHub:

After finalizing the code, I pushed the entire project to a public GitHub repository named CHARISHMA_VU21CSEN0101514.
I chose to keep only the master branch in my repository and deleted the main branch to maintain a clean and organized project structure.
